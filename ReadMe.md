# Glitch Art Gallery

Welcome one and all to the Once In A Lifetime collection of wrestling images. Here we've taken some GIFs and photos of some of the greatest screw-ups and injuries in the WWE and taken away all of their context. You won't see the injury occur, you'll only see the setup and the reaction and never the punchline. This collection is supposed to make you ask the same questions as its namesake, a song by The Talking Heads. Namely you'll be asking yourself "How did we get here" or "what happened to him"? The purpose here is to explore to what extent we can absurdize an already absurd form of entertainment, pushing the line between abstract and nonsensical.

## Update: Data-Bending

New pictures have been added that have been filtered and bent in Audacity.
